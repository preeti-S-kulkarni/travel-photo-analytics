# AI-Powered Travel Photo Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes personal travel photos using **data engineering, data analytics, and AI** techniques.  
Raw image files are transformed into **structured, analytics-ready datasets** by extracting EXIF metadata such as timestamps, camera details, and GPS information.

The long-term goal of the project is to apply:
- Computer Vision
- Machine Learning
- Generative AI  
to understand travel behavior, detect trips automatically, and generate AI-driven travel insights.

✅ **Current status:** Step 1 – Advanced Data Ingestion (Completed)
